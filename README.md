This repository is a collection of explanation I've written while TAing EE122 at San Jose State University. This is mainly about designing circuit based on OPAMPS, diodes, MOSFETs and BJT's with Electronic CAD tools (LTSPICE), portable ADALM2000(M2K) Active Learning analog device, and PCB design tool DipTrace.
